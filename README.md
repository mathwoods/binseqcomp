# binseqcomp
Python script comparing sequential and binary search times; plots times on a graph using matplotlib.

Before running the script, please ensure SciPy is installed. If not, follow the instructions at https://www.scipy.org/install.html for your system.

Use Python 2.7.10 to run the script. Other versions may work, but I only tested it with 2.7.10. In your shell, type

<b>python binseqcomp.py</b>

To learn more about why I wrote this script and and some very basic info about sequential/binary search, check out 

Enjoy!
